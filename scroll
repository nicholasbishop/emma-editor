When cursor goes off the bottom of the pane:
Alter the top_line of the pane such that the cursor is now in the center line of the pane

What does it mean to go off the bottom? The bottom of the cursor is
below the bottom of the pane. Currently all lines have the same
height, so to find the bottom of a line:

    (line_index - top_line + 1) * line_height

...or something like that, +/- 1.
