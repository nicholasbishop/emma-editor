Week of April 12, 2021:
* Added this log file as an experiment; plan is to use it to keep
  track of roughly what I'm working on so that if and when I take a
  break I'm not lost when I come back.
* Started working on undo/redo.
  * Current plan is to make use of ropey's quick cloning rather than
    using the Command pattern; we'll see how it goes.
